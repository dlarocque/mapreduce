# Performance Analysis

Tracking the performance improvements over each major version.

I think it's fun enough to just get a rough idea of how big the improvements
are, so I'm not being very scientific about it for now.

In the original MapReduce paper they were getting runtimes around 5-10
seconds on 10^10 100-byte records (1TB) for various programs. They were running on
1800 machines, but they're old processors (2GHz Intel Xeon with Hyper-Threading
enabled, 4GB memory, two 160GB IDE disks, and gigabit ethernet).

## Initial Version

The initial version is a fully sequential program, with no attempt at writing
performant code.

`examples/wc.cpp`: 20675ms
data: 5 files of randomly selected real words generated by 
`examples/generate_words.py` (16MB each, 80MB total) with a total of about 
11 million words.

super slow!
